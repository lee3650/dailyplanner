# TODO 
## Bugs / verification

- [ ] We need some kind of verification on the `Time` class - make sure negative numbers are not input and make sure that all the values are within range (i.e., 0-23, 0-59 inclusive)

## Features

- [ ] I want to support input for non-military time as well, since we display in non-military time? 

## Gimmicks 

I think we should add a slight gimmick to this to make it more interesting. 

- quote of the day
- sand garden of some kind
- zen garden
- weather in tokyo
    - that's kinda cool honestly... can we um, change the background or something based on the weather? that'd be cool
- maybe some kind of like, anime background could be cool if we can figure it out... 
- zen quote of the day? 

Like, todoist doesn't have *much* of a gimmick, it just looks nice. 

If we just had like, a 'morning' background picture, 'evening', and 'night' or something that'd be maybe good enough.
